# fox-goose-bag-of-corn

One of Lewis Carroll's favorite puzzles to ask children was the one
about the _Fox, Goose, and Bag of Corn_.  It has to do with getting
them all safely across a river.

The rules for this puzzle are:

- You must get the fox, goose, and bag of corn safely across the other side of the river
- You can only carry 1 item on the boat across with you.
- The fox cannot be left alone with the goose, (or it will be eaten).
- The goose cannot be left alone with the corn, (or it will be eaten).

The data structure to represent this puzzle is a list of lists.

The starting position is you, the fox, the goose, and corn on one side of the river. The boat is empty. The other river bank is empty.

```elixir
[
  [[:fox, :goose, :corn, :you] [:boat] []]
]
```

You could take the corn on the boat with you

```elixir
[
  [[:fox, :goose, :corn, :you] [:boat] []]
  [[:fox, :goose] [:boat, :corn, :you] []]
]
```

But then the fox would eat the goose!

The goal is to have the plan in steps so that all make it safely to the other side

```elixir
[
  [[:fox, :goose, :corn, :you] [:boat] []]
 ...
  [[] [:boat] [:fox, :goose, :corn :you]]
]
```
